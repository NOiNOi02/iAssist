  "Sir Isaac Newtonâ€™s laws of motion explain the relationship between a physical object and the forces acting upon it. \nHow did Newton get these ideas?",
  "This law of motion states that every object will remain at rest or in uniform motionin a straight line unless compelled to change its state by the action of an external force.What law of motion this definition pertains to?",
  "When one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal force in the opposite directions on the first object. What law of motion states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction?",
  "This law explains how the velocity of an object changes when it is subjected to an external force. What law of motion defines force as equal to the objects mass times acceleration?",
  "What exists when there is an interaction between two objects?"
